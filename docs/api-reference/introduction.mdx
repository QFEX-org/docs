QFEX provides a unified interface for trading and market data via:

- **WebSocket**: Low latency, real-time market data and order entry.

## Authentication & API Keys

All API calls must be authenticated with an **API Key**. You can create and manage your keys from your QFEX dashboard:

1. Sign in at [app.qfex.com](https://app.qfex.com).
2. Navigate to **Account** → **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create New API Key**, provide a descriptive name, and confirm.
4. **Copy** the generated key and store it securely — it will only be shown once.

### Navigate to API Keys in your Account Menu
