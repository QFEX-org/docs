## Do you have historical data?

Historical data will be available for download soon after launch.

## How do you get underlier prices to compute funding?

We use polygon.io’s real-time data service as the official index data.

## What kinds of market maker protections do you offer?

- A 50ms speed bump on limit orders to prevent latency arbitrage (cancels and liquidity-adding orders are not affected).
- A sensible tick-size regime for our products, designed to keep the market ungapped 50% of the time during liquid hours.

## How are your funding rates computed?

Our funding formula is modelled on Binance’s, with two notable differences:

- Funding is computed and paid every 10 minutes, not 8 hours.
- There is no 1 basis point bias in the formula.
